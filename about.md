    <p>Do you have ideas but lack the technical resources?</p>
    <p>Greater Known specializes in building custom web and mobile software that you can grow with. We do this using the lean startup methodology. This means that we build things with purpose, measure the results, and evaluate what we've learned. We also embrace working remotely because it facilitates and encourages being productive, disciplined, organized, resourceful, and really good at communication.</p>

        How many users do you have? Scalability. Where do your users come from? Conversions. What is your brand? Tone. What is your definition of Done? Usability. As partners, we'll raise timely questions and together devise the scope of your project. We're versed in many technologies. Currently, we're fans of Python+Django back-ends and Javascript+React front-ends, but we also have past/current experience with Flask, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Backbone.js, Ember.js, and CSS.
