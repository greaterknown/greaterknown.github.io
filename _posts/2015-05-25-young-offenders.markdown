      <p>We achieved this through <strong>usability</strong> across browsers and devices and a consistent design language, <strong>readability</strong> through a typographic scale & vertical rhythm, and using common <strong>UI components</strong> for common UI/UX problems: <strong>auto-complete select box</strong> to filter clients via name and service provided, <strong>affix navigation</strong> and <strong>dialog</strong> for maintaining context, <strong>call-to-action button</strong> for conversion optimization. Basic aesthetic changes such as typography, brand colors, and relevant imagery were used to improve brand alignment with prospective clients.</p>
